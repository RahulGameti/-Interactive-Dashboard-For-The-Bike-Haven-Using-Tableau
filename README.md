  Task
 I am excited to have you on board as part of our team at The Bike Haven. As you know, our
 goal is to take the company to new heights, and I believe that your expertise in business
 intelligence can help us achieve that.
 Your task is to create a visually interactive and informative dashboard that will help me
 understand the sales figures better. I want to be able to see how each product category is
 performing, which products are selling the most, and which ones need more attention. I also
 want to be able to see how our sales figures compare to the previous year, and which months
 were the most successful.

  Top10products by sales amount: This will allow you to see which products are
 generating the most revenue for the company.
 ● Top10customers: This will help you identify your most valuable customers, and allow
 you to focus on providing them with excellent customer service and building long-term
 relationships.
 ● Salesfigures vs. budget: You could create a chart or table that compares your actual
 sales figures to your budgeted sales figures for each month. This will help you identify
 any months where you're falling short of your goals, and allow you to take action to
 improve performance.
 ● Salesfigures by region/city: If you have multiple store locations, you could create a
 chart or map that shows sales figures by region. This will help you identify any regional
 trends or opportunities for growth.
 ● Product categories vs. sales amount: Creating a chart or graph that shows product
 category vs. sales will give you an overview of how each product category is performing.
 This can help you identify which categories are generating the most revenue for the
 company and which ones need more attention.
 ● Youcanaddother information to the dashboard to show your creativity, you can also
 create a story instead of dashboard.
